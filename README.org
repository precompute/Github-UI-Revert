* Screenshots
** Border color =#25117fed= and directory block width =80%=
[[file:screenshots/githubUIRevert.png]]
** Border color =#117f2de3= and directory block width =94%=
[[file:screenshots/githubUIRevert2.png]]
* Changes
** Property =border-radius= is =0=.
My eyes couldn't take the corners well.
** Uniform =width= for various elements
Including the heinous top bar.
** Reduced =height= for various elements
+ Top Bar (Github logo and user controls)
+ Status bar above directory block
** All =buttons= are more compact.
Only the padding has been modified.
** Reduced spacing between =Directory= and =About= block

* Issues
** Width of the directory block has to be set manually
Otherwise, the "about" sidebar disappears.
** Search results show the left sidebar at the top
Another tap of ~pagedown~.
** Does not work for mobile view.
And never will.
** Depending on your screen and scaling, YMMV.
This has only been tested on a 1080p monitor.
** I don't want to use the fixed header plugin!
If you don't, there will be padding at the very top of the page. Set the following to =0= to remove it.

#+begin_src css
/* ************Header************ */
body:not(.project-full-screen), .is-stuck {
    padding-top: 45px !important;
}
#+end_src

* Log
** [20-06-30]
Looks like Github changed the top bar's width. Doesn't affect the theme, which has a narrower top bar anyway.
** [20-07-17]
Github stopped using =pagehead=, so I've included a hacky workaround. It works for me, please open an issue if it doesn't for you.
