* Changes
** Property =border-radius= is =0=.
My eyes couldn't take the corners well.
** Uniform =width= for various elements
Including the heinous top bar.
** All =buttons= are more compact.
Only the padding has been modified.

* Issues
** Width of the directory block has to be set manually
Otherwise, the "about" sidebar disappears.
** Search results show the left sidebar at the top
Another tap of ~pagedown~.
** Does not work for mobile view.
And never will.
** Depending on your screen and scaling, YMMV.
This has only been tested on a 1080p monitor.
